#Overview:

This is the project related to the MealDB app. The api from the mealdb website is fetched to obtain the JSON data. Based on this JSON data I have created the website called TheMeal App.

The MealAPP website uses following tools:
1.HTML
2. CSS
3. JavaScript.
4. Some parts of Bootstrap.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this website you can search the food you want. While searching the suggestions will be displayed. We can add the food item to favorites and if needed we can remove it.

The code for the implementation of this website is mentioned in this repository. The appropriate comments are also added which are itself self explanatory.

Feel free to check it and if any concerns reach out us.
